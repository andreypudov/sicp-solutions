; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane.
; Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an
; ending point. Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment
; and end-segment that define the representation of segments in terms of points.
; Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate
; and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
; selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using
; your selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that
; takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose
; coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your
; procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:
;
; (define (print-point p)
;   (newline)
;   (display "(")
;   (display (x-point p))
;   (display ",")
;   (display (y-point p))
;   (display ")"))
