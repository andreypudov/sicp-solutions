; Exercise 1.44: The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in
; signal processing. If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the
; smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the average
; of f (x - dx), f (x), and f (x + dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes as
; input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the
; smoothed f. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is,
; smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed
; function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given
; function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
