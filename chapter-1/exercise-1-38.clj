; Exercise 1.38: In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a
; memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction
; expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this
; fraction, the Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1,
; 6, 1, 1, 8, . . .. Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from
; Exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.
