; Exercise 1.36: Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of
; approximations it generates, using the newline and display primitives shown in
; Exercise 1.22. Then find a solution to x x = 1000 by finding a fixed point of
; x -> log(1000)/ log(x). (Use Schemeâ€™s primitive log procedure, which computes
; natural logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this takes with and without
; average damping. (Note that you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as
; this would cause division by log(1) = 0.)
