; Exercise 1.39: A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was
; published in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
;
;                x
; tan x = ---------------
;                 x^2
;         1 - -----------
;                   x^2
;             3 - -------
;                 5 - ...
;
; where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an
; approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. k specifies
; the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
